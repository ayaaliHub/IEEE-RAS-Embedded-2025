Task Summary: Problem-Solving Using Recursion
Objective:
The task involved solving multiple algorithmic problems using recursion. 
The goal was to apply recursive thinking to break down problems into smaller subproblems and analyze the efficiency and limitations of recursion.

Key Challenges Faced:
Recursive Depth Issues: Some problems required deep recursion, leading to stack overflow for large inputs.

Performance Optimization: Exponential time complexity in naive recursion required memoization or iterative solutions for efficiency.

Edge Cases: Special cases (like N=1) needed additional handling to prevent incorrect outputs.
